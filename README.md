# JGraphs
JGraphs is a GUI, implemented in Java, to manipulate graphs and digraphs.
It can be used to generate and to execute code in other software, like SageMath, C++, etc.
Previuosly, I have used it to compute the Critical Ideals and Critical Groups of Graphs.
This version incorporates a feature that allows the user to export the drawing to Tikz.
Since it was coded in Java, it works on different plataforms.


Basic command for the TextBox:

Kn - Creates a complete graph with n vertices
Pn - Creates a path with n vertices
Tn - Creates a graph with no edges and n vertices

It also can be introduced the Adjacency matrix of a graph


Examples:
Try K10 followed by ENTER
Try {{0,1},{0,0}} to produce an arrow; it also works P2
